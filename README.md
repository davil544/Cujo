**Cujo** is a password manager created for my Senior Project for the Computer Security Technology degree I obtained.  It was created using C# and ASP.net, and is intended to be run on IIS with Microsoft's SQL Server 15 or later.  To get started, you just need to create a database server, preferably on the same machine as IIS so the SQL transactions stay on the server.  You should also create a new user account to allow Cujo to access the database with full write permissions.  Once this is done, run the msSQL_Cujo_DB_Init.sql script to initialize the database for use with this application.  Finally, edit the Web.Config file to change the Data Source field to point to the database IP address, as well as changing the credentials to the ones created earlier.  Note that the SQL server should be configured with a TLS certificate to keep everything as secure as possible, and TrustServerCertificate=true should be set to false once this is done.  This was just included for testing purposes and will trust any certificate if not changed.  At this point, everything should be ready to be published to the IIS server for production use.  Enjoy!
